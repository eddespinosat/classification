# Classification

This repository contains the programs and projects developed during a Pattern Classification course. The course covered the fundamental concepts and practical implementations of classification techniques in Machine Learning, focusing on traditional algorithms.

Contents:
Basic concepts of classification: Understanding patterns, data types, and evaluation metrics.
Traditional Machine Learning algorithms:
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Decision Trees and Random Forests
Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
Among others

Complementary techniques:
Feature selection and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA).
Cross-validation.
Hands-on practice: Implementations using Python (From Scratch) and scikit-learn with real-world datasets.
